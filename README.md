## About The Project

When I wake up, I like to know what my day looks like. What are the activities that are scheduled today? What are some of the tasks I need to complete today? Do I have any mettings/classes today? Do I have any games to watch today? or is it race day? To solve this problem, I wrote a piece of code in python to read my google calendar, F1 race updates, Holidays provided by my university, and Rainbow six siege(videogame) schedule and send me an email every morning. This is completely built with python!!

### So far the project involves:
* Webscraping.
* Interacting with multiple APIs.

## About The Project

When I wake up, I like to know what my day looks like. What are the activities that are scheduled today? What are some of the tasks I need to complete today? Do I have any mettings/classes today? Do I have any games to watch today? or is it race day? To solve this problem, I wrote a piece of code in python to read my google calendar, F1 race updates and Rainbow six siege(videogame) schedule. This is completely built with python!!
